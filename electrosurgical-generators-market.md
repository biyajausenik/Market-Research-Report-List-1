<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrosurgical Generators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopole</li><li>Bipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrosurgical generators are classified into monopolar and bipolar types, each serving distinct surgical applications. Monopolar generators deliver high-frequency electrical currents through a single active electrode, allowing for cutting and coagulation across larger tissue areas. In contrast, bipolar generators utilize two electrodes, enabling precise energy delivery directly to the target tissue, minimizing collateral damage. The choice between these technologies depends on the specific surgical requirements, with monopolar systems favored for broader applications, while bipolar systems offer enhanced precision for delicate procedures.</p></p>
