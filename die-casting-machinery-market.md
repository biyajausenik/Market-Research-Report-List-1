<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Die Casting Machinery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Chamber Die Casting Machine</li><li>Cold Chamber Die Casting Machine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The die casting machinery market is primarily divided into two types: hot chamber and cold chamber die casting machines. Hot chamber machines are suited for low-melting-point metals, utilizing a gooseneck system to inject molten metal directly into molds. This method is efficient for high production rates. In contrast, cold chamber machines handle high-melting-point metals, requiring the metal to be melted in a separate furnace before being transferred for casting. This results in greater versatility for diverse metal applications.</p></p>
