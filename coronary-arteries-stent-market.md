<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coronary Arteries Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal</li><li>Polymer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The coronary arteries stent market is primarily categorized into metal and polymer types. Metal stents, often made from stainless steel or cobalt-chromium alloys, are widely used for their strength and durability, providing effective structural support in the coronary arteries. Polymer stents, on the other hand, utilize biocompatible materials that can be bioresorbable, allowing for gradual dissolution after the vessel is healed. This type aims to reduce long-term complications and improve patient outcomes by minimizing the foreign body presence within the artery.</p></p>
