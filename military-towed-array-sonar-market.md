<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Military Towed Array Sonar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Sonar</li><li>Active Sonar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Military Towed Array Sonar market is primarily divided into two types: passive sonar and active sonar. Passive sonar systems listen for sounds emitted by submarines and other underwater objects, making them stealthy and efficient for detecting threats without revealing their own position. In contrast, active sonar emits sound waves and analyzes the returning echoes to identify and locate targets, offering greater accuracy but potentially compromising the user's stealth. Both types serve critical roles in naval operations and underwater surveillance.</p></p>
